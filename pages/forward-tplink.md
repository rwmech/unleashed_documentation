# Port forwarding on a TP-Link router

Archer series through the web interface, and Deco mesh through its app.

> This opens a door into your own network and you are responsible for what
> comes through it. Read [the warnings](/docs/forward) first if you have not.

<!-- Rob, 2026-10-06: "make sure documentations says something like 'Check to see if this works before you bother reserachiing your router'". The same paragraph on all five router pages, because a reader lands on one of them and never sees the other four. It sits under the warning box and above the first instruction: a pointer, not a shortcut past the warnings. Firmware 1.2.2's port_map and PORTMAP TEST are specified and not built, so this says what they tell you and never what they draw. -->
::: from 1.2.2
**Before you start,** it is worth knowing that from firmware 1.2.2 the board
can ask your router to set this up by itself, and can test whether your
router will do it without changing anything. If your router answers, there is
nothing on this page for you to do. [Let the board ask your
router](/docs/forward#or-let-the-board-ask-your-router).
:::

## Log in

Default address is `http://tplinkwifi.net`, or `192.168.0.1` or `192.168.1.1`
depending on model. Deco uses `192.168.68.1`. If none work, read the default
gateway from a client: Windows calls it Default Gateway, macOS and iOS call it
Router, Android calls it Gateway.

Some models use `admin` / `admin`. Others have no default and make you create a
password at setup. There is no password lookup: some newer models can recover
it through a linked TP-Link ID, and otherwise you hold **Reset** for about 10
seconds with the router powered on, which wipes Wi-Fi settings, internet
settings, the admin password and any forwarding rules you already had.

## Give the board a fixed address

Go to **Advanced > Network > DHCP Server > Address Reservation**, click **Add**,
enter the board's MAC address and the address you want, then enable the entry.
The address must be inside the router's own range. Some models want a reboot.

## Add the rule

The menu depends on which interface generation your model runs, so check the
screen rather than the model number.

- **Older models** (TL-WR840N, TL-WR940N, Archer C20, C50):
  **Forwarding > Virtual Servers > Add New**. Fields are Service Port, Internal
  Port, IP Address, Protocol, Status.
- **Most current Archers** (A9, C7, AX10, AX6000):
  **Advanced > NAT Forwarding > Virtual Servers > Add**. Fields are Service
  Type, External Port, Internal Port, Internal IP, Protocol.
- **Newer premium models** (Archer A8, AX55, AX90, AX11000):
  **Advanced > NAT Forwarding > Port Forwarding > Add**. Fields are Service
  Name, External Port, Internal Port, Device IP Address, Protocol.

For a board on the middle interface: External Port `6400`, Internal Port `6400`,
Internal IP the address you reserved, Protocol `TCP`, then **Save**.

The same page also holds Port Triggering, DMZ and UPnP. Virtual Servers wins
over all three when rules overlap. Do not use DMZ.

## The Tether app

TP-Link's port forwarding documentation covers the web interface only, and does
not describe forwarding in the Tether app. Use the web interface.

## Deco mesh

Documented, and different: **Deco app > More > Advanced > NAT Forwarding > Port
Forwarding**, then the `+` icon. Fields are Service Type (or Custom plus a
Service Name), Internal IP, External Port, Internal Port. Leave Internal Port
blank and it matches the external one.

Deco will not accept a typed address: the board must already be connected and
holding a lease so you can pick it from the list. Some models cap out at 64
rules.

## When it does not work

Double NAT and CGNAT stop any router's forward, and both are
explained on [the main port forwarding page](/docs/forward#two-things-that-will-stop-it-working).
What TP-Link adds:

- **Where the WAN address is.** **Advanced > Status > Internet**, or on Deco
  **More > Internet Connection > IPv4**. A private one means another router
  upstream: forward the same port there too, or bridge the ISP modem.
- **The host firewall.** A blocked listener, or a network profile set to
  Public, looks exactly like a broken router rule.
- **IPv4 only.** Virtual Servers and Port Forwarding are IPv4 NAT features.
  What a TP-Link router does with inbound IPv6 is not covered by its
  forwarding documentation and varies by model, so check yours.
- **Testing from inside.** Loopback is inconsistent. Test from a phone on
  mobile data.
- **Firmware.** Field names, and whether the page is called Virtual Servers or
  Port Forwarding, change between firmware versions on the same hardware.
