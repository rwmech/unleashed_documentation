# Apps for joining

::: applies
Firmware 1.2.0
:::

What you join a board with: a [[telnet client]], the free app that connects
to a board's address and shows its screens. BBS people also call it a
[[terminal]]. Any one works, but some are built for this and look a great
deal better doing it.

## Just tell me what to install

**[SyncTERM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/syncterm/)**, on Windows, macOS or Linux. It is
made for joining boards: it speaks ANSI and CP437 properly, handles file
transfers, keeps a dialling directory, and understands `telnet://` links so
clicking an address on this site actually works. If you install one thing,
install this.

::: next
[Get SyncTERM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/syncterm/)
:::

On a phone, **TERMinator** on
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.terminator.android)
or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminator-bbs-terminal/id6759012939),
and **[MuffinTerm](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/muffinterm/id1583236494)** on
iPhone, iPad and Mac, both do the job and render ANSI art correctly.
**Termius**, free for
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.server.auditor.ssh.client)
and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-modern-ssh-client/id549039908),
works well too. It is a general app for connecting to servers rather than one
made for boards, and telnet is in its free plan.

A Chromebook is the one machine where none of that installs straight into the
browser. It can join a board through its Linux environment or an Android app,
and on a school or work Chromebook both are settings somebody else owns. It has
its own section further down.

## The rest of the modern options

| Client | Platform | Worth knowing |
|---|---|---|
| [SyncTERM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/syncterm/) | Windows, macOS, Linux | The default recommendation. ANSI, CP437, transfers, dialling directory. |
| [NetRunner](https://www.mysticbbs.com/downloads.html) | Windows, Linux | From the Mystic BBS author. Good ANSI. No Mac or Android build. |
| [mTelnet](https://mt32.bbses.info/) | Windows | Small, fast, built for BBSes. |
| [MuffinTerm](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/muffinterm/id1583236494) | iOS, macOS | Handles PETSCII as well as ANSI. |
| [TERMinator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.terminator.android) | Android, iPhone and iPad, ChromeOS with the Play Store | CP437 art, classic fonts, ZMODEM transfers. |
| [Termius](https://termius.com/) | Android, iPhone and iPad, Windows, macOS, Linux | A general SSH and telnet app, not made for boards. Telnet is in the free plan. |
| [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) | Windows, Linux | Everywhere already, but set the character set to CP437 or the art will be wrong. Not built for this. |
| `telnet` | Linux, macOS, BSD | `telnet unleashed.local 6400`. Fine and plain. On Debian or Ubuntu: `sudo apt -y install inetutils-telnet`. |
| `nc` | anywhere | `nc host 6400`. Works, negotiates nothing, and looks it. |

macOS removed its `telnet` command in High Sierra. Install SyncTERM or
MuffinTerm rather than fighting it.

Windows has a Telnet Client too, but it is an optional feature that is off by
default and it renders ANSI poorly. Use something else.

<!-- Site 1.5.4 / docs (Rob, 2026-09-28: "SSH is shipped ... Let everyone know"). Every fact from the firmware's COMMANDS.md on main (the SSH bullets near the top, and the ssh_port row of the settings table) and CHANGELOG 1.1.2: SSH on the S3 boards from 1.1.2; the shared port 6400 for clients that speak first (OpenSSH on Linux, macOS and Windows, PuTTY, Termius); ssh_port 6422 as shipped, where the board speaks first, for SyncTERM 1.9 and older, 0 turns it off, CONFIG network's last row "SSH port (SyncTERM)"; the SSH user name is the handle, an account's handle asks for its password and any other name lands at the ordinary handle prompt; host keys Ed25519 and ECDSA made on the board at its first start, fingerprints shown to staff in SYS and HARDWARE, new keys after an erase or a factory reset. The classic ESP32 boards have no SSH (BBS_HAS_SSH is in the S3 profiles only). -->
## Connect with SSH

**SSH is here: encrypted connections on every ESP32-S3 board, from firmware
1.1.2.** Over [[SSH]], everything between your computer and the board is
scrambled on the way, your password included. Telnet stays open on every
board, for the machines that cannot encrypt, and boards on a classic ESP32
take telnet only.

```
ssh -p 6422 yourhandle@board.example.com
```

- **Port 6422 is SSH's own.** There the board speaks first, which SyncTERM
  1.9 and older need: use 6422 with SyncTERM, never 6400. The sysop can move
  it or turn it off (0) in `CONFIG network`, on the **SSH port** row.
- **The telnet port takes SSH too**, 6400 as shipped, for apps that speak
  first: OpenSSH (the `ssh` command on Linux, macOS and Windows), PuTTY and
  Termius. `ssh -p 6400 yourhandle@board.example.com` works with those.
- **The SSH user name is your handle.** A handle with an account asks for
  that account's password, and you arrive logged in. Any other name gets in
  with no password asked and lands at the ordinary login prompt, where you
  can sign up or visit as a guest.
- **The first time, your app asks whether to trust the board's key.** The
  key is made on the board at its first start. To check it, ask the sysop,
  who sees its fingerprints in `SYS` and `HARDWARE`. If your app later warns
  that the key has changed, ask the sysop why before you trust it again: an
  erase or a factory reset makes new keys.

## Chromebooks

::: art
term-chromebook
:::

A Chromebook you control can usually join a board. A school or work
Chromebook usually cannot, until whoever manages it switches something on.
Chrome on its own never can: no web page and no Chrome extension is allowed to
open the kind of plain network connection telnet needs, so every route below
goes around the browser rather than through it. On a managed Chromebook, every
one of those routes is a setting that belongs to the administrator.

**Find out which kind of Chromebook you have before anything else**, because
it changes the answer. Select the time at the bottom right, then **Settings**,
then **About ChromeOS**, then **Developers**. If there is a **Linux
development environment** row with a **Set up** button, you are fine. If the
row is missing, or the button refuses, the device is managed and an
administrator has turned it off. [A few older Chromebooks never had
it](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux/).

### If Linux is available

This is the route that works, and it ends with an ordinary terminal.

1. Select the time at the bottom right, then **Settings**, then **About ChromeOS**, then **Developers**.
2. Next to **Linux development environment**, select **Set up**, and answer the few questions it asks. Google says setup takes ten minutes or more, and that is about right.
3. A **Terminal** window opens when it finishes. What you are looking at is Debian.
4. Install a telnet client: `sudo apt -y install inetutils-telnet`
5. Join a board: `telnet 192.168.1.50 6400`, with the address and port from the listing. On an ESP32-S3 board you can [call over SSH](#connect-with-ssh) instead, which is encrypted: `ssh -p 6400 yourhandle@192.168.1.50`.

Use the numeric address rather than a `.local` name. The Linux side looks
names up for itself and does not always see what ChromeOS can see, so a name
that works in the browser can fail in the terminal for reasons that have
nothing to do with the board.

### If Linux is blocked

Then it is a conversation with whoever manages the devices, and it goes better
if you ask for the setting by name instead of asking for Linux.

- It lives in the Google Admin console, under **Devices > Chrome > Settings**, on the **User & browser settings** page, in the section **Virtual machines (VMs) and developers**.
- The setting is called **Linux virtual machines (BETA)**. On managed devices it defaults to **Block usage for virtual machines needed to support Linux apps for users**, which is why yours is off.
- The value to ask for is **Allow usage for virtual machines needed to support Linux apps for users**. It can be set for one group of people rather than for everybody.
- If people sign in with accounts from outside the organisation's own domain, the matching setting on the **Devices** page, **Linux virtual machines for unaffiliated users (BETA)**, has to be allowed too, or the first one appears to do nothing.

> [!NOTE]
> Worth saying in that conversation, because it is usually the real question:
> this starts a sandboxed Debian container. It is not developer mode, it does
> not unenrol the device, and by Google's own description a bad Linux app can
> affect other Linux apps and nothing outside them.

### The other ways in, and what each costs

- **An Android app, if the Play Store is switched on.** [TERMinator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.terminator.android) is a BBS terminal that speaks telnet and draws CP437 art properly. On a managed Chromebook the Play Store is its own separate setting, under **Devices > Chrome > Apps & extensions > User app settings**, then **Additional app settings**, then **Android apps on Chrome Devices**, then **Allow users to install Android apps**. On school devices it is frequently off, and it is a bigger thing to ask for than Linux is, because it opens a whole store rather than one program.
- **A Chrome extension cannot do this**, and that is worth knowing before you spend an afternoon looking for one. Google's own Secure Shell is an SSH client and does not speak telnet. Nothing else can either: opening a plain connection was a Chrome Apps ability, not an extension one, and ChromeOS 138, in July 2025, was the last release to support Chrome Apps a user installed themselves. Google's newer route for web apps that need a raw connection, Isolated Web Apps, installs only through an administrator's policy, so it is the administrator's decision like everything else here.
- **A terminal that runs in a web page needs a helper in the middle.** A page cannot open a telnet connection, so clients like [fTelnet](https://www.ftelnet.ca/) connect over WebSocket to a proxy and the proxy makes the telnet connection for them. It works. It also means that proxy reads everything in both directions, which on a telnet board is everything, your password included. Running the proxy yourself on your own network is a fair trade. Using somebody else's is a public conversation with one more listener in it.

If none of those is available to you, a Chromebook cannot join a board over
telnet, and there is no trick that gets round it. The machine is doing exactly what it was
set up to do. Borrow a Windows, Mac or Linux computer for the evening, or ask
for the Linux setting, which is the smallest of the three requests.

## Clicking an address instead of typing it

Every board on the list has its address as a link. Whether that link does
anything depends on which program your computer has registered for
`telnet://`, and the default is often wrong or missing. [How to fix
that](/docs/dialing).

The address is ordinary text inside the link, on purpose, so selecting it and
pasting it into a terminal always works, whatever your machine does.

## Joining from something older

This is the more interesting half. A board answers anything that can open a
telnet session, and with a bridge that includes machines built before the
protocol was common.

| VIC-20, PET, Plus/4 | period terminal software | a user-port RS-232 interface to a bridge |

The board speaks PETSCII natively, at 40 or 80 columns. A Commodore does not
answer the board's probe the way a PC terminal does, so on connect the board
asks you to press DEL, then whether you are on 40 or 80 columns. A C64 gets a
C64 screen, not an approximation of one.

## What a bridge is

::: art
term-bridge
:::

Most of the machines above have a serial port and no idea what TCP is. A bridge
sits between the two: it takes the serial line on one side and speaks telnet on
the other, so the old machine thinks it is talking to a modem.

Hardware ones for Commodore and Atari are listed above. On anything with a
serial port, an ESP32 running [Zimodem](https://github.com/bozimmerman/Zimodem)
does the same job for a few dollars, and so does `tcpser` on a computer you
already have. A real modem and a real phone line also still work, if you have both.

## What the board does with all this

It works out what it is talking to when you connect and draws itself to
suit, so an Amiga, a TRS-80, a phone and a modern laptop can be in the same chat room
and each see something that looks right to it. The first call page says [how, and what
it may ask](/docs/firstcall#it-works-out-what-you-are).
