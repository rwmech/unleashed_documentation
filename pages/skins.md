# Skins

A board with a screen can dress up as a machine from another decade. A skin is
a picture of a computer, a terminal or a front panel, and the board lights its
lamps for real: the drive lamp flickers when the card is read, a power lamp
blinks with network traffic, a row of panel lamps follows the lights effect,
and the board's name, address and callers appear on the picture's own screen.

You draw the machine. The board makes it glow.

:::

A skin is two files, a picture and a short text file, and nothing you put in
them can break the board. If a skin is missing or has a mistake in it, the
screen shows the board's built-in layout, called `status`, and the board tells
you what was wrong and on which line.

You can send a skin to the board over the same connection you call it with,
from your terminal program, without touching the card.

## What you need

- **A board with a display.** The skins that come with the board are drawn
  for the [Makerfabs ESP32-S3 with the 3.5 inch
  screen](https://unleashedbbs.com/hardware#makerfabs-esp32-s3-parallel-tft-3-5-v1-0), which is 480
  by 320 pixels. The Waveshare S3's small screen, 172 by 320, takes skins
  too, drawn for its size.
- **An SD card** in the board's card slot. Skins live on the card.
- **A terminal program that can send a file by YMODEM**, such as SyncTERM,
  to send skins to the board. Or a card reader, to copy them onto the card.
- **A picture**, from any paint program, photo editor or pixel art tool.
- **A text editor**: Notepad, TextEdit in plain text mode, nano, anything that
  saves plain text.
- **For the helper tool, optional but worth it:** Python 3.8 or later and the
  Pillow imaging library, on a Windows, Mac or Linux computer.

## The stock skins

Five, drawn for the 480 by 320 screen. Each picture is the skin as the board
draws it, lamps lit and status lines on its screen:

::: skins
skin-pc.png | `pc`: a beige tower PC with its monitor. The hard disk lamp is the drive light
skin-c64.png | `c64`: a breadbin home computer with its disk drive and monitor
skin-apple2.png | `apple2`: a beige computer with a lid, a green screen and two floppy drives
skin-atari.png | `atari`: a cream computer with its drive, and a wood-grain television
skin-imsai.png | `imsai`: a front panel with paddle switches. Its 16 address lamps are the strip
:::

**Coming soon for display-enabled boards: the firmware with skins is in
testing.** The skins are ready now, in two zips holding the same five:

- [Download the stock skins for the card](/skins/skins.zip): `skins.zip`,
  about 100 KB, laid out the way the card wants them. Unzip it at the top of
  the card, and you have a `skins` folder with a folder inside for each skin.
- [Download them as pairs to send](/skins/skins-upload.zip):
  `skins-upload.zip`, about 100 KB, the same five as ten files, `pc.txt` and
  `pc.jpg` and so on, ready to send through the board's Skins file area.

A later release puts them on the card by itself.

**No logos, and no trademark art.** None of the stock skins carries a maker's
badge, logo or name: they are drawings of a kind of machine, not of a product.
A skin you make or share must not use them either.

## The five-minute version

The quickest way to a skin of your own is to start from one that works.

1. Unzip `skins.zip` on your computer. You get a `skins` folder with one
   folder inside for each skin.
2. Copy one of them, the `pc` folder say, and name the copy after your skin:
   `my_tower`. A skin's name is 1 to 24 letters, digits, `_` or `-`, and
   cannot be `status`.
3. Replace `background.jpg` in the copy with your own picture, exactly 480 by
   320 pixels, saved as an ordinary JPEG with the progressive option off.
4. Open `skin.txt` in the copy and move the lights and the text to where they
   sit on your picture. The sections below say how.
5. Check it, look at it lit, and turn it into the pair of files the board
   takes:

```
python tools/mkskin.py check my_tower
python tools/mkskin.py preview my_tower -o my_tower.png
python tools/mkskin.py pair my_tower -o to_send
```

6. Call the board, log in as the sysop and type `FILES 12`, which opens the
   Skins area. Press `U` and send `to_send/my_tower.txt` by YMODEM, then `U`
   again for `to_send/my_tower.jpg`.
7. Type `CONFIG panel`, choose `my_tower` on the **Skin** row and save.

## Get the tool

`mkskin.py` checks a skin by the board's own rules, converts pictures, finds
the lights for you, shows the skin lit, and makes the pair of files for
sending, all before anything reaches the board. It is in the `tools` folder of
[the firmware's repository](https://github.com/rwmech/unleashed_BBS) once
skins are released: download the whole repository (the green **Code** button,
then **Download ZIP**) and run the tool from inside it, because the preview
borrows the screen's font from the repository's source.

Pillow installs with:

```
python -m pip install pillow
```

On Windows the command may be `py` rather than `python`. On a Debian or Ubuntu
system that refuses `pip`, use `sudo apt install -y python3-pil` instead.

The `check` command needs no Pillow at all, only Python.

## The picture

**The picture is exactly the screen's size.** 480 by 320 for the 3.5 inch
screen. The board does not resize, and a picture of any other size is
refused. If you have turned the screen with the **USB plug** setting, the size
turns with it: stood on end, the Waveshare's screen is 172 wide and 320 tall,
on its side 320 by 172.

**The picture is a baseline JPEG.** The ESP32-S3 draws it with a small JPEG
decoder built into the chip, and that decoder is old and particular:

- Baseline, not progressive. If your editor's save dialog has a
  **Progressive** option, turn it off.
- Colour. A greyscale JPEG is refused, and so is CMYK, which is a printing
  setting.
- 8 bits a channel, which is what nearly every editor saves.
- Chroma subsampling of 4:4:4, 4:2:2 or 4:2:0. Every common setting is one of
  these.

If a picture will not pass, or you are not sure what your editor did, let the
tool make the JPEG for you. It takes a PNG, a JPEG or most other formats:

```
python tools/mkskin.py jpeg my_art.png -o my_tower/background.jpg
```

A picture of another shape is cropped from its middle to fit, never
stretched (add `--stretch` if you want it stretched). For the Waveshare, add
`--size 172x320`.

**Paint every lamp dark, the way it looks switched off.** The board adds light
on top of the picture and never takes any away, the way a real lamp behind
coloured plastic does. A dark red lens glows red when the board lights it and
looks like an unlit lamp when it does not. A lens painted bright already has
nowhere to go.

Leave the machine's screen area in the picture looking like a screen, dark and
plain: the board writes its status lines there.

The stock pictures are about 20 KB each. Size is not a worry.

## skin.txt

A short text file that says where each light and the text go. This is the
`pc` skin's, complete:

```
skin 1
panel 480 320
name Beige tower
; the hard disk lamp, a flicker for every read
drive 428 210 6 pc halo=5
; the turbo lamp, here for traffic
activity 392 210 6 colour=#FFC020 halo=5
; the monitor's tube, grey on black
text 46 58 224 128 colour=#C8C8C0 background=none
lines name address uptime callers today heap who
clock 222 38 colour=#C8C8C0
```

Positions are in pixels, counted from the top left corner of the picture: X
across to the right, Y down. Any paint program shows you the X and Y of the
spot under the mouse pointer.

| Line | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skin 1` | The format. Always the first line, always `1` |
| `panel 480 320` | The screen it is drawn for, width then height. Must match the picture |
| `name Beige tower` | A title, up to 24 characters. `PANEL` shows it beside the skin's name. CONFIG lists skins by their names, not their titles |
| `drive X Y D STYLE` | The drive light: its centre, the lens's diameter in pixels, and its style: `pc`, `1541`, `disk2` or `breathe` |
| `activity X Y D` | The activity light, which blinks with network traffic. `colour=#RRGGBB` sets its colour: green if you leave it out |
| `strip N` | How many strip lamps the skin has, 1 to 16. A `led` line for each follows |
| `led I X Y D` | Strip lamp number I: its centre and diameter. Each lamp from 1 to N, once |
| `text X Y W H` | The rectangle the status lines are written in: its top left corner, width and height |
| `lines ...` | What the rectangle shows, top to bottom, from the words under [the text and the clock](#the-text-and-the-clock) |
| `clock X Y` | The time, as HH:MM, with its top left corner at X Y |

Every line but `skin` and `panel` is optional, and each appears once. A skin
with no lights and no text is a picture on the screen, and that is allowed.

The details:

- A lens is 2 to 64 pixels across.
- `halo=N` on any light sets how far its glow spreads past the lens, 0 to 32
  pixels. Leave it out and the glow is half the lens's diameter.
- Options go after the fixed values, as `name=value`, with no spaces around
  the `=`. `colour` can also be spelt `color`.
- Colours are written `#RRGGBB`, the six-digit hex colour every paint program
  shows: `#FF3A20` is a warm red.
- Words can be in capitals or not. Spaces or tabs separate them.
- A line starting with `#` is a comment, and so is anything after a `;`.
- Plain text only, at most 120 characters a line and 4 KB for the file.

The text rectangle and the clock take these options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `size=small` or `size=big` | Small letters are 8 by 16 pixels, big ones 16 by 32. Small if you leave it out |
| `colour=#RRGGBB` | The letters' colour. Light grey for text and yellow for the clock if you leave it out |
| `shadow=#RRGGBB` | A shadow one pixel down and to the right, for text over a busy picture. `none` for no shadow, as it is if you leave it out |
| `background=#RRGGBB` | A solid colour behind each line. `none`, as it is if you leave it out, writes the letters straight onto the picture |
| `align=left`, `centre` or `right` | Where each line sits in the rectangle. Text only, not the clock |

**Nothing may overlap.** Each light takes a square box, its lens plus its halo
on every side, and no two boxes, and no box and the text rectangle or the
clock, may touch the same pixel. Everything has to fit on the screen too. The
board redraws each thing by itself, many times a second, and this is what
lets it do that without smudging its neighbour. Lamps close together want a
smaller halo: a 6 pixel lens with `halo=5` takes a 16 pixel box.

## The lights

Three kinds, each drawn as light rather than paint: a lens that glows brighter
at its centre, with a soft halo spreading onto the picture around it.

**The drive light** follows the board's real storage: amber when the SD card
is read or written, cool white for the board's own memory, and a slow red
blink after a storage error. Its style is how it behaves:

- `pc`: a short flash on each access and a flicker through a long one, like
  an IBM PC's hard disk lamp.
- `1541`: lit for the whole access, like a 1541 floppy drive.
- `disk2`: lit for about a second after the last access, like the Apple II
  Disk II, whose motor kept running.
- `breathe`: a slow pulse at rest, with the access colour on top.

**The activity light** blinks with network traffic, in any colour you give it.
A power lamp or a turbo lamp on the picture makes a good one.

**The strip** is up to 16 lamps that show whatever effect the lights plugin is
running: `nodes` with a lamp for each caller line, `hayes` like a modem's front
panel, `blinken` like a mainframe's, and the rest listed on [the lights
page](/docs/lights). It works with no LED strip wired to the board at all.

The drive light and the strip come from the lights plugin, so it has to be
switched on. On some boards it is on as shipped. If those lamps stay dark on
your skin, type `CONFIG lights` and switch it on; it runs happily with nothing
wired. Two of its settings reach the skin as well:

- **Strip len** is how many strip lamps the lights plugin drives, 10 as
  shipped. A skin with 16 lamps wants it set to 16, or lamps 11 to 16 stay
  dark.
- **Brightness** dims the lamps on the picture as it would dim a real LED.
  At 30% or more they are drawn at full brightness.

The activity light does not need the plugin.

## Placing the lights with key colours

Finding the centre of a 6 pixel lens by hovering a mouse over it gets tedious
by the third lamp. The tool can find them for you: paint a dot of a bright
colour over each lamp on a copy of your picture, and it measures each dot and
writes the lines.

Any colour works as a key, as long as it appears nowhere else in the picture.
These are the ones the example below uses:

| Paint | Colour | How many |
|---|---|---|
| The drive light | magenta `#FF00FF` | One dot |
| The activity light | cyan `#00FFFF` | One dot |
| The strip lamps | yellow `#FFFF00` | Up to 16 dots |
| The text rectangle | green `#00FF00` | One filled rectangle |

1. Make a copy of your background, at full size, and save it as a PNG. Work
   on the copy only, never on `background.jpg`.
2. Paint a solid dot of its key colour over each lamp, the size of the lens,
   and a filled rectangle where the status lines go. Turn antialiasing off in
   your brush settings if you can.
3. Run the tool on the copy, naming each colour, the drive style you want and
   where to write the result:

```nowrap
python tools/mkskin.py leds keyed.png --key drive=#FF00FF --key activity=#00FFFF --key led=#FFFF00 --key text=#00FF00 --style 1541 -o my_tower/skin.txt
```

4. It writes a ready `skin.txt`, something like this:

```
skin 1
panel 480 320
drive 306 166 13 1541
activity 445 230 11
strip 4
led 1 265 285 11
led 2 285 285 11
led 3 305 285 11
led 4 325 285 11
text 48 52 189 113
lines name address callers who
```

5. Open it in a text editor and add what the tool cannot guess: a `name`, the
   activity light's colour, the text's colour, and the `lines` you want.

Worth knowing:

- `-o` replaces whatever file it names, so point it at a new skin's folder,
  or leave it off and the lines appear on screen for you to copy.
- `-o` writes plain text the board reads. Sending the screen output to a
  file with `>` in Windows PowerShell writes a kind of text file the board
  refuses, so use `-o` there.
- Strip lamps are numbered the way you would read a panel: the top row first,
  left to right, then the next row down.
- The diameter is the dot's width or height, whichever is larger. Paint the
  dot the size of the lens, not the size of the glow.
- A clock can be placed the same way with `--key clock=#RRGGBB`: its dot marks
  the clock's top left corner.
- `--halo N` sets the same halo on every light it writes.
- If a colour is not found, the tool says so and leaves that light out.
  Saving as a JPEG blurs colours, which is why the copy is a PNG.

## The text and the clock

The words on the `lines` line choose what the rectangle shows, one per row,
top to bottom:

| Word | Shows | For example |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | The board's name | The Rusty Antenna |
| `address` | The address and port callers dial | 192.168.0.40:6400 |
| `uptime` | How long since the board started | up 3d 4h |
| `callers` | Callers on, out of the lines there are | Callers 2/11 |
| `today` | Calls since midnight | 14 calls today |
| `heap` | Free memory | 84K free |
| `card` | Free space on the SD card | card 29 GB free |
| `clock` | The time | 21:47 |
| `date` | The date | Sat 26 Sep |
| `last` | The most recent login, logoff or page | 21:40 login alice |
| `ring` | Who is ringing for the sysop, empty when nobody is | alice is ringing |
| `blank` | An empty row, for spacing | |
| `who` | Who is on, one caller a row, in every row left | 1) alice 7m |

`who` fills the rest of the rectangle, so it goes last. Until the board has
the time from the internet, `clock` shows `--:--` and `date` shows nothing.

The rectangle has to be tall enough for its lines: 16 pixels a row for small
letters, 32 for big. Six small lines need a rectangle at least 96 pixels tall.
A line wider than the rectangle is cut short at its edge; small letters take
8 pixels each, so a 224 pixel wide rectangle holds 28 characters.

The separate `clock` line puts the time anywhere on the picture, on top of a
TV cabinet or in a panel's readout. It is 40 by 16 pixels in small letters, 80
by 32 in big ones.

## Check it and see it lit

Before it goes to the board, check the skin:

```
python tools/mkskin.py check my_tower
```

A good skin says `my_tower: ok`. A skin with a mistake says what and where,
with the same words the board would use:

```
my_tower:
  skin.txt line 9: led 2's box overlaps led 1's (line 8)
```

Then look at it:

```
python tools/mkskin.py preview my_tower -o my_tower.png
```

Open `my_tower.png`. It is your picture with every lamp lit the way the board
lights it and made-up status lines written in the screen's own font, so you
can see whether the text sits in the monitor and the glow sits on the lamp.
The drive light shows amber, as if the card were being read, and some of the
strip lamps are lit and some are not. The pictures of the stock skins above
were made the same way.

## Sending it to the board

On a board with a display, the file areas have one called Skins. It is area
12 on the Makerfabs 3.5 inch board, and 14 on a board that also has a camera.
Staff can look in it and download from it; only the sysop can send to it, and
what the sysop sends is in at once, with no approval step.

A transfer carries one file, not a folder, so the Skins area takes a skin as
a pair of files with the skin's name: `my_tower.txt`, which is its `skin.txt`,
and `my_tower.jpg`, which is its picture. The tool makes the pair from a skin
folder, checking it first:

```
python tools/mkskin.py pair my_tower -o to_send
```

That leaves `my_tower.txt` and `my_tower.jpg` in a folder called `to_send`.
For the stock skins, `skins-upload.zip` above is already in pairs. Then:

1. Call the board and log in as the sysop.
2. Type `FILES 12`, or `FILES 14` on a board with a camera. At the file area
   menu, `#12` and Enter does the same.
3. Press `U`. The board says it is ready; start a YMODEM upload in your
   terminal program and choose `my_tower.txt`.
4. Press `U` again and send `my_tower.jpg` the same way.
5. Type `CONFIG panel`. On the **Skin** row (**Panel skin** on a wide
   terminal), press Space to step through the choices to your skin, and save.

The board loads the skin in the background, so callers are never held up. The
`status` layout stays on the screen until the skin is ready.

Worth knowing:

- **Sending a file that is already there replaces it.** Send a new
  `my_tower.jpg` and the board reads the skin again, even if it is on the
  screen at that moment.
- **The board refuses any other name** as the transfer starts, before any of
  the file is kept, and says why: `Skins takes <name>.txt and <name>.jpg,
  name 1-24 of A-Z 0-9 _ -.` The name follows the same rule as a skin's
  folder.
- **`E` erases a file there**, by its number in the list. With either half
  gone, CONFIG stops offering that skin.
- **A folder beats a pair.** If the card has a folder `skins/my_tower/` as
  well as the pair, the board reads the folder. Give a skin you send a name
  of its own.

## Or copy it onto the card

If you would rather use a card reader, a skin can go on the card as a folder,
the same layout as `skins.zip`:

```
skins/
  my_tower/
    background.jpg
    skin.txt
```

1. Log in as the sysop and type `SD UNMOUNT`, so the card can come out safely.
2. Take the card out and copy your skin's folder into the card's `skins`
   folder. Make the `skins` folder at the top of the card if it is not there.
3. Put the card back and type `SD MOUNT`. The board may pause for a moment
   while it reads the card.
4. Choose it in `CONFIG panel` as above.

**Changing a skin that is already on the screen this way.** The board keeps a
loaded skin in memory and does not reread the card for it by itself. After
copying a new version onto the card, choose `status`, save, choose your skin
again and save. Restarting the board works too. Sending the new version
through the Skins area instead does all of that for you.

## Choosing a skin

The **Skin** row in `CONFIG panel` lists `status` and up to 16 skins from the
card, in name order. It lists only skins that have both their files, whose
`skin.txt` reads cleanly, and that are drawn for this screen's size. If yours
is missing from the list, run `check` on it.

## When it does not show

Type `PANEL`. Among what it prints, a line says which skin is on the screen,
with its title from the `name` line: `Skin my_tower (My tower)`. When it is
not the one you chose, that line says `Skin status` and a red line under it
says why:

```
Skin status
Not my_tower: skin.txt line 9: led 2's box overlaps led 1's (line 8)
```

The same reason goes to the board's console. The ones you are likely to meet:

| PANEL says | What to do |
|---|---|
| `Not my_tower: background.jpg is 640x480; the panel is 480x320` | Make the picture exactly the screen's size. `mkskin.py jpeg` does it |
| `Not my_tower: background.jpg: progressive JPEG: save it as baseline (not progressive)` | Save it again with the progressive option off, or use `mkskin.py jpeg` |
| `Not my_tower: background.jpg: greyscale: save it in colour (YCbCr)` | Save it as a colour JPEG, even if the picture is black and white |
| `Not my_tower: background.jpg: fill bytes between segments: save it again as baseline` | Rare. Save it again, or use `mkskin.py jpeg` |
| `Not my_tower: background.jpg: an empty segment the decoder refuses: save it again` | Rare. Save it again, or use `mkskin.py jpeg` |
| `Not my_tower: skin.txt line 9: led 2's box overlaps led 1's (line 8)` | Move the lamps apart or give them a smaller `halo` |
| `Not my_tower: skin.txt line 4: 'drvie' is not a skin directive` | A typo on that line |
| `Not my_tower: skin.txt line 7: 3 lines of 16 px need 48 px; the rectangle is 40` | Make the text rectangle taller, or show fewer lines |
| `Not my_tower: skin.txt line 1: a character that is not plain ASCII (byte 239)` | The editor saved the file as "UTF-8 with BOM". Save it as plain text, ASCII or UTF-8 without BOM |
| `Not my_tower: drawn for a 480x320 panel; this one is 172x320` | The skin is for another screen, or the screen has been turned |
| `Not my_tower: no skins/my_tower/ or skins/my_tower.txt on the card` | Neither the folder nor the pair is there, or the name differs by a letter |
| `Not my_tower: no background.jpg (or my_tower.jpg) beside its skin.txt` | The picture is missing: send `my_tower.jpg`, or copy `background.jpg` into the folder |
| `Not my_tower: no SD card` | The card is not in, or not mounted: `SD MOUNT` |
| `Not my_tower: loading` | Nothing is wrong. Give it a second |

The line numbers count every line of `skin.txt`, blank lines and comments
included, starting from 1, the way a text editor numbers them.

**After fixing a skin that failed,** the board tries it again when you send a
new file for it through the Skins area, when you save any page of `CONFIG`,
after `SD UNMOUNT` and `SD MOUNT`, or after a restart. It does not keep
retrying on its own, so that a broken skin is not reread over and over.

## Sharing a skin

When a skin looks right, the tool packs it for somebody else:

```
python tools/mkskin.py pack my_tower -o my_tower.zip
```

It checks the skin first and refuses to pack one with a mistake in it. The zip
holds `skins/my_tower/` with both files, so whoever receives it unzips it onto
the top of their card as it is, or runs `pair` on the folder and sends it
through their Skins area. Several skins go in one zip:
`python tools/mkskin.py pack my_tower my_terminal -o my_skins.zip`. A
`README.txt` in a skin's folder goes into the zip too, which is a good place
to say who drew it.

Two things before you share:

- **Use art you made or have the rights to.** A photo from a web search
  belongs to whoever took it.
- **Leave makers' logos and names off the machine.** A drawing of a beige
  tower is yours to give away. A company's badge on it is not.

## When the board puts the stock skins on the card

A later release puts the five stock skins on the card by itself and keeps them
current when new versions ship. It never overwrites one you have changed: once
you change any file in a stock skin's folder, the board treats the whole
folder as yours and leaves it alone. A stock folder you delete comes back, so
make your own skins under names of their own rather than editing `pc` or
`imsai` in place.
