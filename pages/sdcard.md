# Adding an SD card

> [!NOTE]
> **The Waveshare S3 needs none of this.** Its card slot is on the board:
> [the S3](https://unleashedbbs.com/hardware#waveshare-esp32-s3-lcd-1-47).

Optional, and for the ESP32 dev board. A board with no card is a complete
board: chat, mail, accounts, screens, the caller log, a directory listing, the
serial bridge. The card is what you add when you want file areas, forums and
screens of your own.

<!-- Nightly backups: firmware CHANGELOG 1.1.0-dev.6, `nightly = yes` on CONFIG sd, one at 03:00, the last seven nightly-YYYYMMDD.zip kept, hand-made backups never pruned. -->
::: until 1.1.0
Firmware 1.1.0 gives the card one more job: switch on nightly backups and the
board backs itself up to the card at 03:00 every night, keeping the last seven.

::: from 1.1.0
The card can also keep the board's backups: switch on nightly backups and the
board backs itself up to the card at 03:00 every night, keeping the last seven.

A module that costs about two dollars, and four signal wires plus power.

## What you need

- A micro SD card module with an SPI breakout. The pin names below are the
  ones the common modules print on the board.
- A micro SD card, 32 GB or smaller, formatted **FAT32**.
- Jumper wires: four signal wires plus power.

> Cards larger than 32 GB ship formatted as exFAT, which this does not read.
> Reformat as FAT32 or use a smaller card. Windows will not offer FAT32 above
> 32 GB in the right-click Format dialog, and `diskpart` refuses it as well.
> Windows 11 with the April 2026 update or later can do it from a terminal,
> with `format X: /FS:FAT32` where X is the card's drive letter; otherwise a
> smaller card or a third-party formatter.

## The wiring

| Module pin | ESP32 pin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `3V3` or `VCC` | `3V3` | **Start on 3V3.** Some modules want 5 V: see below. |
| `GND` | `GND` | |
| `CS` or `SS` | `D5` / GPIO5 | Change it in the config if you need to |
| `MOSI` or `DI` | `D23` / GPIO23 | |
| `SCK` or `CLK` | `D18` / GPIO18 | |
| `MISO` or `DO` | `D19` / GPIO19 | |

> Use the 3V3 pin to start with. It is the choice that cannot damage anything:
> a module with no regulator on it needs 3.3 V, and 5 V on one of those goes
> straight to the card and can reach the ESP32's pins, which are not built for

GPIO5 is one of the ESP32's strapping pins, but Espressif's datasheet gives it
one job at power-on, with GPIO15: the timing of an SDIO interface this board
does not use. So a card module on it does not stop the board booting, and the
shipped `cs = 5` is right. If you would rather CS were on a pin with no
strapping role at all, move it to `D4` and set `cs = 4` in the config. Nothing
else needs to change.

## Telling the board about it

Nothing, if you used the pins above. Wire it up, power cycle, and it mounts
at boot.

To check, log in as sysop and type `SD`:

```
SD card
  SDHC/SDXC at /sd, 20 MHz
  29123 MB free of 30436 MB
  screens: /sd/screens
```

If you moved a pin, `CONFIG` has an `sd` page with all four, or edit the
section directly:

```
[plugin:sd]
cs = 4
mosi = 23
clk = 18
miso = 19
screens = yes
```

## When it does not work

`SD` says which problem it is, in the board's own words.

| What it says | What it usually means |
|---|---|
| no card found | The card is not seated, or `CS` is on the wrong pin, or `MISO`/`MOSI` are swapped |
| card found but no FAT filesystem | It is exFAT or NTFS. Reformat as FAT32 |
| card answered then failed | The card started to talk and then stopped. Check the power line and the ground, and see the note above about modules with a regulator. `CONFIG sd` can also lower the bus speed |
| SPI bus would not start | A pin number in the config is one the board cannot use |

`SD MOUNT` tries again without rebooting. It pauses the whole board for a
moment while it negotiates with the card, which is why it is a command you
type rather than something that retries by itself.

`SD UNMOUNT` flushes and releases the card so you can pull it safely.

## What goes on the card, and what does not

| On the card (FAT32) | On the board (LittleFS) |
|---|---|
| File areas | Accounts and passwords |
| Forums | The configuration |
| Your own screens | The caller log |
| A copy of the caller log | The stock screens |

The split is deliberate. FAT32 is readable on any laptop, which is the whole
point of using it: pull the card, plug it into a PC, and your board's files
are ordinary files. The cost is that FAT is not safe against losing power
mid-write, so nothing that has to survive lives there. Accounts stay on the
board's own flash, which is.

Pulling the card does not break the board. It goes back to the stock screens,
and the file areas and forums are not available until the card is back.

## Screens of your own

Put a screen in `/sd/screens` with the same name as a stock one and yours is
used instead. A name the card does not have falls back to the one that
shipped, so you can replace a single screen without supplying all of them.

The file extensions are the same as on the board: `.ans` for ANSI, `.asc` for
plain ASCII, `.seq` for PETSCII, and `.p40` or `.p80` for a PETSCII screen
drawn for 40 or 80 columns.

Set `screens = no` in the config if you would rather the card were ignored
for this.

Your screens are played straight from the card, and nothing copies them into
the board. Pull the card and the board goes back to the stock screens it
shipped with: nothing breaks, but your own screens are gone until the card is
back.

<!-- SCREENS INSTALL (Rob, site 1.2.9): from firmware 1.1.1, so gated on it; the words are Rob's description of the command, not yet checked against a build. The 256 KB is the board's storage partition (partitions.csv), which holds the screens. -->
::: from 1.1.1
To keep them without the card, type `SCREENS INSTALL` as the sysop. It copies
the card's screens into the board itself, after checking they fit in its
256 KB of screen space; if they do not, it refuses and copies nothing, rather
than installing half of them. `SCREENS INSTALL STOCK` puts the stock set back,
and so does the next firmware update.
